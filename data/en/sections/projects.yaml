- name: VFIO Gaming Project
  timeline: "January 2018 - 2020"
  summary: During this time, I was deeply experimenting with VFIO and IOMMU. I was daily driving a VM rather than the host machine. This allowed me some unique experience in regards to VM optimization that not a lot of professionals have.
